started working on 3 seperate ideas
1. X ai reply bot - mostly for personal use. A web extension interface over X, with flexibility of choosing a model, tone and iterate over first draft via chat. 
2. prompt ops - prompt versioning, rbac, evals, auto-tuning, testing etc. GTM research is underway.
3. pitch coach - ai powered roleplay voice agent with context of your product, who you'll talk to, what you'll sell and other parameters so that you can role play the pitch. It can be a sales pitch, investor pitch, hiring pitch or anything. This is the least fav as of now.
